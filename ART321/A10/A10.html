            <h1>Interaction</h1>
        <p>
            Play through the interactive piece 'Every Day the Same Dream" as far as you can, or to the end. Write a description of the actions you take and their results as you move through it (don't do it later, it won't work properly). From this create a description of the branches the story takes as a function of your choices. 
        </p> <br/>
            <p>The game can be downloaded here: <a href="everydaythesamedream.exe">Everyday The Same Dream</a></p>
            
        <p><strong>1. How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches?</strong></p>
        <p>
        This style of narrative allows you to progress through the story after you hit certain major checkpoints in the game. Your life is basically a never-ending cycle until you go out of your way to experience with these random events. The five main variations that allow you to progress through the narrative (as tracked by the old woman in the elevator) are: <br/>
        Get out of your car and talk to the cow  <br/>
        Pick up the leaf when you get off outside of work  <br/>
        Talk to the homeless man beside your apartment  <br/>
        Go into work without getting dressed and get fired  <br/>
        Go past your cubicle and jump off the roof  <br/>
             <br/>
        These do not need to be done in any particular order.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p><strong>2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story. </strong></p>
        <p>
            The graphics of the game are very bland and colorless. The only exception is when there is something that the game wants you to interact with, where they are usually bright and vibrant. Not only is the change in color palette a way to show players when something is able to be interacted with, it is a narrative device showing how the main character sees everything in his mundane life. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <p><strong>3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels. </strong></p>
        <p>
            The interactions that the creator of the game are very simple and minimalistic. The only controls the player has are to walk left or right and to perform an action by pressing space when a caption comes up at the bottom of the screen. However, these minimalistic controls are more than enough to convey the artistic message that the creator has established. In a sense, the lack of extraneous controls like jumping (this isn’t a platformer) or running contribute to the overall dull and slow feel of the game and allows you to put yourself more into the main character’s shoes.

<p><strong>Steps that I recorded while playing the game:</strong></p>
<p>
Start game <br/>
Walk left and turn off alarm that’s beeping red. It turns off. <br/>
Walk right and put on clothes from wardrobe <br/>
Walk out of room and talk to wife <br/>
Turn off the flashing TV <br/>
Talk to wife who is cooking meal. She responds “Come on honey, you’re late” <br/>
Press the elevator button and it turns red and opens up but I miss it because I’m typing this. <br/>
Get on the elevator with an old lady. I talk to her and she says “5 More Steps and I’ll be a new person. <br/>
Drive to work <br/> 
I get off and see a leaf and wait for it to fall and pick it up. <br/>
I walk into work and my boss tells me I’m late. <br/>
I walk by 5 other workers on my way to the cubicle. They all look like me. <br/>
I walk to the next row and there are 7 more that look exactly like me <br/>
I find my desk around 9 more just like me. I then wake up the next day. <br/>
This time I don’t dress up and just walk past my wife without turning the TV off. <br/>
I talk to the old lady again and the step counter has gone down. <br/>
This time I walk left at the parking lot instead of going to my car. <br/>
I talk to a homeless man and he says “I can take you to a quiet place.” We go to a graveyard and the day resets. <br/>
I do the same thing and try to see the homeless man again but he’s not there. <br/>
I go to work with no clothes on. The leaf isn’t there this time. <br/>
I get fired by my boss because I’m not wearing a tie.<br/>
I talk to the old lady again and she says 2 more steps. <br/>
I notice the graph keeps going down when I get to the office. <br/>
This time I walk past my cubicle and too the roof. It asks me if I want to jump. I do it. <br/>
The day resets again. <br/>
This time I get out of my car and walk to the left. There is a cow. <br/>
This time I notice that the graph has plummeted all the way to the bottom. <br/>
I go to work. <br/> 
I notice that my wife isn’t there anymore. <br/>
The old lady isn’t there either. <br/>
There aren’t any more cars on the road. <br/>
The cow isn’t there either. <br/>
My boss and the other workers aren’t there. <br/>
I walk to the roof and see someone who looks just like me. The music stops and the wind eerily blows. <br/>
He drops before I can stop him. <br/>
